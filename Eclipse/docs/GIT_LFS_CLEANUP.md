# Git LFS Large File Cleanup - Eclipse Project

## Issue Resolution

Fixed Git LFS large file size limits by removing unnecessary build artifacts and distributions.

## Files Removed

- `Eclipse/build-tools/gradle-8.5-bin.zip` (126.38 MB)
- `Eclipse/build-tools/gradle-8.5/` directory and all contents
- **Total Space Saved**: ~129 MB

## Why These Files Were Removed

1. **Gradle Distribution ZIP**: The `gradle-8.5-bin.zip` file is a complete Gradle distribution that can be downloaded automatically by the Gradle wrapper
2. **Extracted Gradle Directory**: The `gradle-8.5/` directory contains the same files as the ZIP, duplicating the space usage
3. **Build Artifacts**: These files are not necessary for source control and can be regenerated

## How Gradle Still Works

- The Gradle wrapper (`gradlew` and `gradlew.bat`) remains in the repository
- When building, the wrapper will automatically download the correct Gradle version if needed
- No functionality is lost, only unnecessary large files are removed

## Prevention

Updated `.gitignore` to prevent future commits of:

- `/build-tools/` directory
- `gradle-*-bin.zip` files
- `gradle-*-all.zip` files

## Result

- Repository is now Git LFS compliant
- Build functionality preserved through Gradle wrapper
- Faster clone/download times for the repository

# Audio Loading Issue - Quick Summary

## Issue Created
**Title:** Enhanced RotationalRhythm: Audio files not loading into selection list for ring assignment

## Problem
Users report that after loading audio files using "Load Sounds Folder", the files don't appear in the dropdown selection when adding new instrument rings.

## Key Symptoms
1. ✅ Success message shows "Loaded X audio files" 
2. ❌ Sound dropdown is empty when adding rings
3. ❌ Error message "Please load a sounds folder first!" appears
4. ❌ Cannot assign custom sounds to rhythm tracks

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue likely stems from one or more of these factors:
- **Audio format compatibility** - Java Sound API limitations
- **File loading errors** - Silent failures not visible to user
- **UI synchronization** - HashMap updated but dropdown not refreshed
- **Exception handling** - Errors caught but not properly reported

## Proposed Solutions
1. **Enhanced error reporting** with detailed feedback
2. **Improved validation** of audio files before loading  
3. **Better UI state management** ensuring dropdown updates
4. **Robust exception handling** with user-friendly messages

## Technical Details

- **Line range:** ~208-312
- **Priority:** High (blocks core functionality)

## Testing Needed

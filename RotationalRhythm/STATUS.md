# Enhanced Rotational Rhythm - Project Status

## Overview
Successfully enhanced the RotationalRhythm project with advanced audio capabilities and visual rhythm sequencing features.

## Key Enhancements Made

### 🎵 Audio System
- **Multi-format support**: WAV, AU, AIFF, AIF files
- **Dynamic audio loading**: Load sounds from any folder
- **Real-time playback**: Synchronized audio playback with visual beats
- **Sample generator**: Utility to create test audio files (kick, snare, hi-hat, cymbal)

### 🎨 Visual Interface
- **Clock-like design**: Circular layout with 16-beat patterns
- **Multiple rings**: Each ring represents a different instrument
- **Color coding**: Customizable colors for each instrument track
- **Interactive beats**: Click to toggle beats on/off
- **Real-time indicator**: Visual marker showing current beat position
- **Tempo clock hand**: Animated center hand that rotates to visualize BPM and current beat
  - Center circle displays current BPM value
  - Clock hand rotates smoothly through each measure
  - Tempo scale markers show quarter and sixteenth note positions
  - Hand resets to 12 o'clock position when stopped

### 🎛️ Controls & Features
- **BPM slider**: Adjustable tempo from 60-200 BPM
- **Play/Stop**: Real-time rhythm playback control
- **Add/Remove rings**: Dynamic instrument track management
- **Clear tracks**: Reset individual instrument patterns
- **Instrument selection**: Choose sounds for each ring

## Technical Implementation

### Core Classes
1. **EnhancedRotationalRhythm.java** - Main application class
   - UI layout and event handling
   - Audio management and playback
   - Timer-based rhythm sequencing

2. **RhythmPanel** - Custom drawing component
   - Clock face visualization
   - Beat position rendering
   - Mouse interaction handling

3. **RhythmRing** - Data structure for instrument tracks
   - Beat pattern storage
   - Color and sound association
   - Toggle functionality

4. **AudioSampleGenerator.java** - Utility for creating test sounds
   - Procedural audio generation
   - WAV file output
   - Multiple drum sound types

### Audio Architecture
- **HashMap-based clip management**: Efficient audio file caching
- **Swing Timer**: Precise beat timing and synchronization
- **Java Sound API**: Cross-platform audio support

## Build System
- **build-enhanced.bat**: Compiles enhanced version only
- **run-enhanced.bat**: Launches the main application
- **run-audio-generator.bat**: Creates sample audio files

## Usage Workflow
1. Build application with `build-enhanced.bat`
2. Generate test sounds with `run-audio-generator.bat`
3. Launch app with `run-enhanced.bat`
4. Load audio folder (use generated audio-samples folder)
5. Add instrument rings and program beats
6. Adjust BPM and press Play

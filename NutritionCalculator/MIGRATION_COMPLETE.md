## Architecture Transformation

### Before: Monolithic Java Swing

```java
public class SimpleNutritionCalculator extends JFrame {
    // UI components mixed with business logic
    private JTextField ingredientField;
    private JTextArea nutritionDisplay;
    private List<Ingredient> ingredients = new ArrayList<>();
    
    // Everything in one class - ~800 lines
    public void calculateNutrition() {
        // Business logic embedded in UI
    }
    
    public void updateDisplay() {
        // Manual UI updates
    }
}
```

### After: Clean Architecture Android

```kotlin
// Presentation Layer
@Composable
fun NutritionCalculatorScreen(
    viewModel: NutritionViewModel = hiltViewModel()
) {
    val uiState by viewModel.uiState.collectAsState()
    // Declarative UI with automatic state updates
}

// Domain Layer
class CalculateNutritionUseCase @Inject constructor(
    private val repository: NutritionRepository
) {
    suspend operator fun invoke(ingredients: List<Ingredient>): NutritionFacts
}

// Data Layer
@Repository
class NutritionRepositoryImpl @Inject constructor(
    private val localDataSource: NutritionDao,
    private val remoteDataSource: USDAApiService
) : NutritionRepository
```
